### POST ABOUT MCP
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is here to make your AI agents & Agentic applications even more powerful üí™  
  
MCP, which started as a project by Anthropic, is now the talk of the town.  
Even though it was introduced a few months ago, developers have gradually begun to understand its importance.  
  
Its a protocol that‚Äôs trying to standardize how LLMs access external data and tools.  
  
So why everyone is talking about it suddenly?  
MCP simplifies the lives of developers by providing a standardised protocol for integrating AI agents with external tools and data sources.  
  
It promotes interoperability, reduces the need for custom integrations, and streamlines AI application development. MCP acts as a universal adapter, enabling LLMs to access real-world data and perform actions in a consistent and scalable manner.  
  
MCP offers benefits such as enhanced context awareness, streamlined development, and improved security, making it a valuable tool for AI tool integration. The goal is for MCP to be the USB-C of AI, allowing for standardised AI model interactions.  
  
MCP fosters an ecosystem of reusable connectors, allowing developers to build once and reuse them across multiple LLMs and clients, eliminating the need to rewrite the same integration in numerous ways. This unified data access means that with MCP, one protocol is configured, and then the LLM can "see" all registered connectors.  
  
For example, now MCP servers let you connect Claude to powerful tools like GitHub, Slack, and Google Maps. These integrations help you save time, streamline workflows, and focus on what matters most.  
  
Forget RAG, MCP is poised to significantly benefit AI agents and agentic applications by enabling more autonomous, context-aware, and efficient workflows.  
  
Great times are ahead!

### POST ABOUT WHY US WINS
I know why the US wins.  
  
Young role models.  
  
Having been in the MIT-Harvard belt for ~2 months, I‚Äôve realised that while 99% of students at top American and Asian universities are similar, the top 1% in the US is 10x better than the top 1% in Asia.  
  
This top 1% has mastered both storytelling and an industry-specific hard skill. Investors scout them. Capitalism supports their ambition.  
  
[Mach Industries](https://www.linkedin.com/company/machindustries/) (largest Series A in defense at $79 million) was started and run by a 19-year-old MIT dropout. What makes it exemplary is that Mach was then working on hydrogen-powered bombs.  
  
As many of these startups emerge from top universities, founders recruit classmates as founding engineers. If the company goes on to succeed, the engineers have a compelling story to tell their next employer or investor. It becomes a flywheel. It convinces people that ‚Äúyou can just do things.‚Äù  
  
It took 39 years to see cricket‚Äôs first double-hundred, but there were nine more in the next 13 years.  
  
What India and Singapore currently lack is young role models. Only a matter of time before it changes.  
  
Goal: be role-model worthy :)


## POST ON WHY AGE IS GETTING IRRELEVANT DAY BY DAY 

Be interested to be interesting.  
  
Recently, I have started to initiate conversation with 2-3 people every day, randomly.  
  
No intention. No expectation. No bias for age, gender, ethnicity etc.  
  
It is surprising what a "Hello!" coupled with a smile can do.  
  
It is simple: If a voice inside me encourages me to talk to someone, I simply do. I don't let the inner voice overpower and prevent me from taking action.  
  
The questions are templatized:  
- are you working/researching in the belt?  
- where are you originally from?  
- why do you do what you do?  
  
Interestingly, most people proceed to ask the same questions. Humans are innately social. End the conversation by exchanging contacts. Easy.  
  
Approaching people without hesitation is a muscle one can build. It is learnable.  
  
Follow energy. Detach from the outcome.  
  
  
PS - thanks for the activation energy to post, [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAVIH5sB8gYGRCX4EmcNMCuEZrkcielg4Ww)[Adam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-elitzur/)!

## POST ON PROGRESS - 1 
I was at the lowest point of my life exactly two months ago.  
  
Only my parents knew.  
  
I did not celebrate Christmas, New Year or even my birthday.  
I didn‚Äôt tell my friends. I just wanted to run away, far away.  
  
On paper, I had the absolute best year:  
- Fully-funded US trip  
- Vacation in Europe  
- Stay at Vanyavilas  
- Trek in Kashmir  
- Launched product for [Pawsible Foods](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pawsiblefoods/)  
- Received grants from NUS and Deputy PM of Singapore, Mr. [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAOZpFMBZASrcdHHVRkha_4U0mwHqF-sHh4)[Lawrence Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lawrence-wong-15728a18/)  
  
But I was not fine; mentally or physically.  
  
I had built a system of preventing a low point by standardising my life:  
- Sun in the morning for setting the circadian rhythm  
- Clean diet for regular energy in the day  
- Exercise for expending excess energy  
- Yoga and meditation for mental calmness  
- Book/podcast to learn about other fields  
- Work on meaningful problems with people I like  
- Sleep 7-8 hours and wake up without an alarm  
- Talk to friends and family  
  
But I faltered. I failed.  
  
I had gained a lot of weight. I was eating sugar and drinking caffeine just to survive through the day.¬†Clothes weren‚Äôt fitting me well.  
  
3 people in my family passed away. It was the first time I was part of a funeral and the ceremonies.  
  
I was in and out of the hospital the entire December. So many tests and medicines that I lost track. No one knew and I didn‚Äôt tell anyone because I held myself in such high respect.  
  
I had to return from a high-altitude trek prematurely. This was a punch in the stomach for someone who‚Äôs been trekking since he was 9. For someone who is the first person to be selected in a sport, who has led teams to victory, it was heart-wrenching.  
  
I lost my identity, I lost myself and I hated it.¬†I was ashamed of myself.  
  
I lost my drive to work. Nothing made sense.  
  
I remember crying incessantly without any reason.  
  
  
I cut out sugar and caffeine cold turkey. Removed all packaged food and replaced everything with whole foods. Started eating dry fruits and nuts and drank apple cider vinegar. Reset my microbiome.  
  
I am proud to say that I have dropped all my excess weight.  
  
Now I am:  
- Rowing every week  
- Playing pickleball 3 times a week  
- Going to the gym or swimming on other days. My day begins with yoga and breath-work.  
- Eating two healthy meals with high volume foods. I eat in a 6-8 hour window.  
- Sleeping 6-8 hours every night.  
  
and I am:  
  
- Working as a research assistant¬†at the [Singapore-ETH Centre](https://www.linkedin.com/company/singapore-eth-centre/).  
- Doing a full-time degree in Chemical Engineering with a second major in Innovation and Design at NUS  
- Handling [Pawsible Foods](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pawsiblefoods/)  
- Doing [The Draft Podcast](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-draft-podcast/)  
- Managing the [Delhi Smart Protein Project](https://www.linkedin.com/company/delhispp/)  
  
I love my life. I am mentally the calmest.  
  
  
This note is a reminder that everyone is fighting their own battle and the least we can do is be kind.  
  
This experience taught me the importance of one‚Äôs support system. You know who y'all are and I‚Äôm super grateful to have you in my life.  
  
  
PS - Never be afraid to cut negativity from your life, especially people.

## POST ON APPRECIATING -1 
[Pawsible Foods](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pawsiblefoods/) wouldn‚Äôt exist without [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAADlwFU0BLNyi--dIeWMGevW5dENu2XFN8dw)[Samyak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samyak-baid/).  
  
It would be a figment of my imagination.  
  
Samyak and I met for the first time on 27th July at NUS and we were a part of [Singapore Management University](https://www.linkedin.com/company/singapore-management-university/)'s incubator within a month.  
  
Our conversations would go on for hours at a stretch, sometimes pulling off an all-nighter unintentionally. We only discussed innovation, science and business.  
  
Things to look for in a Co-Founder?  
  
- Ambitious Doer. Everything boils down to execution.  
  
- Similarity in long-term vision. Fights on this is the 2nd biggest reason for startup failure, after money.  
  
- Intrinsic motivation for the cause. Consistency is underrated. Everything compounds.  
  
- Complimentary interests; not everyone likes Operations, Finance, Legal, HR  
  
- Someone you'd learn from, personally and professionally.  
  
- Someone who is fun to work with.  
  
- Someone you can be candid with. Entrepreneurship is said to be an extremely lonely journey.  
  
Samyak checks all the boxes and much more.  
  
Super excited for the future. Many many projects in store.  
To tinkering with ‚àû pawsibilities :)

## GOOD HOOK POST EXTENSIVE POST
It's 2025 but some businesses are still:  
  
- Using an old marketing playbook;  
- Spamming with dull content and emails;  
- Leading with assumptions, not research.  
  
They keep making mistakes.  
  
In the meantime, best B2B brands follow the current best practices.  
  
Because they know one thing:  
  
Marketing has changed in the past 2 years:  
  
- Massive disruption with AI  
- The rise of personal brands  
- New content-first playbook  
- Constant need for innovation  
- Big changes in outbound tactics  
  
I included the 7 best practices in the infographic enclosed.  
  
And to use them, you need to follow thes 3 rules:  
  
1. Rethink your marketing priorities  
  
What led you to success in the past won't necessarily lead you to your next success. Reassess your target market to spot the evolutions, trends, new realities, and audience changes.  
  
2. Align team on what matters: revenue  
  
The 'growth at all cost' of the past years is over. Marketing teams need to recenter around revenue targets. Audit your marketing function and highlight what actions bring revenue to the table. But don't get too obsessed with direct ROI.  
  
3. Lead with innovation, not fear of change  
  
You should not fear adapting to new marketing playbooks (demand gen, AI, ABM, personal brands). Instead, commit 20% of your resources to experimentation to test those new tactics.

## GOOD HOOK MEDIUM POST 

Buyers don‚Äôt buy the way you think.  
  
Here are 3 weird ‚Äúdark socials‚Äù patterns:  
  
1. Screenshots: people screenshot social posts and ads when they think ‚ÄúI might need this‚Äù.  
  
2. Content-triggered impulsive buy: CEO discovers a topic from a social post and shares ‚Äúwe need this‚Äù to the team (usually with a screenshot).  
  
3. Group messages: someone asks in a group message ‚Äúdo you know someone for (skill)‚Äù? And someone else in the chat says ‚ÄúI would need (skill) too‚Äù.  
  
Those are just 3 examples.  
  
But they are part of a broader trend.  
  
Buying journeys are decentralized.  
  
- People don‚Äôt fit your ‚ÄúTOFU/MOFU/BOFU‚Äù funnels.  
- They don't want to be pushed in agressive sequences.  
  
I realized this in 2023 and stopped creating complex funnels.  
  
Instead I structured my marketing with:  
  
- A lot of high quality content (authority-first)  
- A demand capture system (for conversions)
